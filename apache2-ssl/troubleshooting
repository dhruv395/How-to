######if you get below fastcgi error in apache2, and can't access website,
server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting

then we need to modify few parameters in phpfpm conf file,
vim /etc/php/7.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

pm.max_children = 128
pm.min_spare_servers = 2
pm.max_spare_servers = 10
pm.process_idle_timeout = 60s;
pm.max_requests = 0
